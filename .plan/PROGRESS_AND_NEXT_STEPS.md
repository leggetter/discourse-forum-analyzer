- [x] End-to-end tested and validated

### Full Dataset Collection
- [x] Fixed base URL issue (.com ‚Üí .dev)
- [x] Collected 271 topics, 1,201 posts, 324 users
- [x] Date range: Sep 2024 - Oct 2025
- [x] Database: 1.62 MB, English content ‚úÖ

### Basic Analysis
- [x] SQL-based keyword extraction
- [x] Problem category classification
- [x] Top topics by engagement
- [x] Pattern detection (73% webhook delivery issues)

## üîÑ Current Phase (Phase 2)

### LLM-Based Analysis (IN PROGRESS)
Goal: Use Claude API for semantic problem analysis and interactive querying

**Why LLM over Traditional NLP:**
- Better semantic understanding of developer problems
- No need for complex NLP pipelines or vector DBs
- Faster implementation with superior results
- Cost-effective: ~$0.01-0.05 for full analysis
- Enables interactive querying of the dataset

### Implementation Breakdown

#### 2.1 Structured Problem Analysis (Current Focus)
1. Create `llm_analyzer.py` with Claude API integration
2. Batch analyze topics (10 per API call)
3. Extract: core problems, categories, severity, key terms
4. Identify common themes across all topics
5. Store results in new DB tables (llm_analysis, problem_themes)
6. Generate actionable problems report

**CLI Commands:**
- `forum-analyzer llm-analyze` - Run structured analysis
- `forum-analyzer problems-report` - Generate markdown report

**Database Schema Additions:**
- `llm_analysis` table - Per-topic analysis results
- `problem_themes` table - Common problem clusters

#### 2.2 Interactive Querying (Included in Current Phase)
7. Add `forum-analyzer ask "question"` command
8. Query engine that loads relevant context from database
9. Conversational responses using Claude API
10. Caching of common queries for performance

**CLI Command:**
- `forum-analyzer ask "What are the most common HMAC issues?"`

**Features:**
- Natural language questions about the forum data
- Context-aware responses using database + LLM
- Examples of useful queries provided in help
- Query history tracking (optional)

#### 2.3 Future: MCP Server (Phase 3+)
- Expose forum data as MCP resources
- Provide query/search tools via MCP
- Enable exploration via Claude Desktop, IDEs
- More flexible than CLI for advanced analysis

## üìã Detailed Remaining Tasks

### Phase 2: LLM Analysis (Current)
- [x] Update plan with LLM implementation details (THIS TASK)
- [ ] Add API key to config.yaml
- [ ] Implement LLM analyzer core (`llm_analyzer.py`)
- [ ] Add database tables for LLM results
- [ ] Create CLI commands: `llm-analyze`, `problems-report`
- [ ] Implement interactive `ask` command
- [ ] Test with sample queries
- [ ] Generate comprehensive problems report
- [ ] Update README with LLM features

### Phase 3: Finalization
- [ ] Create final documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples for all features
- [ ] (Optional) Design MCP server architecture
- [ ] (Optional) Implement MCP server

### Phase 4: Future Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] MCP server implementation
- [ ] Web dashboard for visualization
- [ ] Automated monitoring for new forum activity
- [ ] Integration with Shopify product team workflows

## üéØ Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ 100% topic coverage (271/271)
- ‚úÖ >95% API success rate
- ‚úÖ Zero data loss on failures
- ‚è≥ AI-driven problem identification (in progress)
- ‚è≥ Interactive querying capability (in progress)
- ‚è≥ Actionable insights report
- ‚è≥ User-friendly CLI interface for analysis

## üí° Example Usage (After Phase 2)

**Setup:**
Add your Claude API key to `config/config.yaml`:
```yaml
llm_analysis:
  api_key: "your-anthropic-api-key-here"  # Get from https://console.anthropic.com
  model: "claude-opus-4"
  batch_size: 10
  max_tokens: 4096
  temperature: 0.0
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run structured analysis
forum-analyzer llm-analyze --limit 50  # Test with 50 topics
forum-analyzer llm-analyze              # Analyze all topics

# Generate problems report
forum-analyzer problems-report --output reports/problems.md

# Interactive querying
forum-analyzer ask "What are the top 5 webhook delivery problems?"
forum-analyzer ask "How many topics mention HMAC validation failures?"
forum-analyzer ask "What's the most critical unsolved problem?"
```

## üìä Database Schema Updates

Current tables:
- categories, topics, posts, users ‚úÖ
- checkpoints ‚úÖ

To add in Phase 2:
- llm_analysis (per-topic analysis results)
- problem_themes (common problem clusters)
- query_cache (optional - for ask command performance)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Changes

Update `config/config.yaml` to add:
```yaml
llm_analysis:
  api_key: ""  # Your Anthropic API key
  model: "claude-opus-4"
  batch_size: 10
  max_tokens: 4096
  temperature: 0.0
  
  # Optional ask command settings
  ask:
    context_limit: 50  # Max topics to include in context
    cache_queries: true
```
